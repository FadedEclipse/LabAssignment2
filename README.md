Lab Assignment 2 - Chadd, Antonio, Harley

Welcome to the Assignment! :mechanical_arm: 

Our proposed design is a bartending set-up that utilises the KUKA KR 6 R900 Sixx and UR3 (potential to change). The two robots will work in harmony to create several drinks including some cocktails, beer, and wine. Allowing a seamless experience from ordering to serving. The system will incorporate numerous safety features to ensure patrons are always kept safe (E-stop, sensors, barriers etc.). There will be an appropriate GUI where users can select the drink that they would like. In addition, there will be a joystick controller where patrons can move the robot in a safe manner. 

The team have decided to implement the KUKA KR 6 R900 Sixx as our new industrial robotic arm, due to it holding many appropriate specifications that meet our criteria . Firstly, the KUKA KR 6 R900 Sixx incorporates six degrees of freedom which is essential for our application of moving glass bottles and pouring liquids. The robot has a reach of 901mm which ensures efficient picking and placing of alcoholic beverages. The robots repeatability is +-0.03mm ensuring minimal errors are experienced during the demonstrations. The KUKA KR 6 R900 Sixx has compact size and can adapt to many different workspace environments.
